## Uses of "Platforms"

### [DAO Primitives Framework](./primitives.md##%5Ea80a6b)

In the context of organizations and systems, **platforms** are digital or organizational infrastructures that facilitate the interaction, collaboration, and exchange of resources or services, especially in decentralized environments like Web3/DAOs, enabling the creation and distribution of public goods and driving social impact initiatives.Resources are assets or materials, such as money, time, equipment, or knowledge, that are utilized to achieve [goals](tags/goals.md), complete tasks, or support activities.**The promise of capture-resistant governance is managing shared resources in a way that prevents capture of those resources by bad actors.** In so doing, it also unlocks a new frontier of what is possible together. The amazing fluidity, flexibility, and adaptability exhibited by early web3-native communities is testament to whatâ€™s possible when our governance structures avoid capture of shared resources without the rigidity of traditional approaches.In the context of organization and systems design, actions are the measurable processes or events through which resources are created, exchanged, or transformed, driving the flow of value within the system.
