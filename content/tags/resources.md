## Uses of "Resources"

### [DAO Primitives Framework](./primitives.md##%5E6d6e1a) 

In the context of organizations and systems, particularly in Web3, **resources** refer to the assets— such as funds, data, infrastructure, or human capacity —that are collectively managed, shared, and allocated through decentralized networks to achieve common goals.Platforms are structures or environments that facilitate interactions, exchanges, or services between [agents](tags/agents.md), enabling the development and coordination of various activities or solutions.In the context of organization and systems design, actions are the measurable processes or events through which resources are created, exchanged, or transformed, driving the flow of value within the system.

### [Anticapture](../library/Anticapture.md)

In [Anticapture](../library/Anticapture.md), _resources_ are defined as anything that can be used to achieve desired outcomes, including tangible assets like food, money, and energy, as well as intangible ones like attention and social reputation. The term distinguishes between _private resources_, controlled by a single [agents](./agents.md), and _shared resources_, governed by a network of agents. Shared resources are particularly vulnerable to capture, making decentralized governance essential to protect them from misuse or control by bad actors

**The promise of capture-resistant governance is managing shared resources in a way that prevents capture of those resources by bad actors.** In so doing, it also unlocks a new frontier of what is possible together. The amazing fluidity, flexibility, and adaptability exhibited by early web3-native communities is testament to what’s possible when our governance structures avoid capture of shared resources without the rigidity of traditional approaches.
