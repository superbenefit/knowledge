Resources are assets or materials, such as money, time, equipment, or knowledge, that are utilized to achieve [goals](./goals.md), complete tasks, or support activities. ^22f819

## Uses of "Resources"

### [DAO Primitives Framework](./primitives.md##%5E6d6e1a) 

Primitives are the most basic, foundational elements or operations in any system or domain, serving as the essential building blocks from which more complex structures, processes, or concepts are created.

## Uses of "Primitives"

Primitives can be seen across various domains, such as programming (e.g., data types, basic operations like addition), hardware (e.g., logic gates, transistors), and software architecture (e.g., messaging protocols, database queries). Their simplicity and generality make them highly reusable, flexible, and reliable, allowing systems to scale and evolve while maintaining clarity and modularity.

In both web3 tooling and systems design, "primitives" refer to basic, foundational components or operations that are simple, reusable, and interoperable, serving as essential building blocks for creating more complex applications, services, or systems by combining or extending them.

### Primitives in Systems Design

In systems design and #organization , #primitives refer to the most basic, foundational components or operations that cannot be simplified further but are used to build more complex systems. These building blocks provide standardized functionality or abstractions, allowing for the creation of larger, more sophisticated systems by combining or extending them.

### Primitives in web3

In #web3 tooling, primitives refer to basic building blocks or fundamental components that developers use to create decentralized applications (dApps) and blockchain-based systems. These include elements like tokens, wallets, smart contracts, consensus mechanisms, and decentralized identities, which serve as reusable, interoperable pieces of code or protocols. By combining and extending these primitives, developers can efficiently build more complex applications and services within the decentralized ecosystem.

### Primitives in this repository

Some notes in this knowledge garden represent primitives, and include metadata to help you navigate and discover them.

Notes which represent #primitives are indicated using the [primitive](tools/types/primitive.md) file class (`type: primitive`). This file class (a subclass of [resource](tools/types/resource/resource.md) and [link](link.md) ) contains several metadata fields which are either inherited or unique.

## Primitives in Practice

Organizations can benefit from primitives by leveraging these basic building blocks to streamline processes, improve efficiency, and enhance flexibility. By breaking down complex tasks or systems into simpler, reusable components, they can standardize operations, reduce redundancy, and adapt quickly to changes.

These elements are simple, repeatable, and can be applied across different departments or projects, allowing the organization to maintain consistency while adapting to various challenges. By utilizing these foundational building blocks, organizations can ensure that their operations are efficient, flexible, and aligned with their strategic goals.

At SuperBenefit, we're exploring the potential and practical uses of web3 primitives in the [DAO Primitives Project](notes/primitives/primitives.md). For help choosing the patterns, practices and primitives for your project, check out the [group facilitation framework](notes/primitives/group-facilitation.md). You can learn more about our approach in the [conceptual framework](notes/primitives/framework/framework.md).

### [Anticapture](../library/Anticapture.md)

In [Anticapture](../library/Anticapture.md), _resources_ are defined as anything that can be used to achieve desired outcomes, including tangible assets like food, money, and energy, as well as intangible ones like attention and social reputation. The term distinguishes between _private resources_, controlled by a single [agents](./agents.md), and _shared resources_, governed by a network of agents. Shared resources are particularly vulnerable to capture, making decentralized governance essential to protect them from misuse or control by bad actors

**The promise of capture-resistant governance is managing shared resources in a way that prevents capture of those resources by bad actors.** In so doing, it also unlocks a new frontier of what is possible together. The amazing fluidity, flexibility, and adaptability exhibited by early web3-native communities is testament to whatâ€™s possible when our governance structures avoid capture of shared resources without the rigidity of traditional approaches.
